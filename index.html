      <p> My hobby is reading both, interesting and knowledgeable books. After completing my home work and Whitehat Jr projects I just like to read books. Now I know that reading books have a mountain of advantages, I will list a few- Reading enhances your vocabulary, Boosts your imagination, Makes you enter a world full of knowledge and facts and fantasy. Back to me, I love the Adventurous books of Geronimo Stilton because whenever I read them I make a beautiful world of my own in my mind. And of course I love reading knowledgeable books like Books on History, Science etc. Reading books is a good source of enjoyment, knowledge and inspiration. It makes us disciplned, punctual and most importantly a successful person in life. </p>
      <h3> HAPPY READING! </h3>
